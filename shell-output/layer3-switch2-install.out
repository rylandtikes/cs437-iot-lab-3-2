***************************************************************
This is a normal Router with a SW module inside (NM-16ESW)
It has been preconfigured with hard coded speed and duplex

To create vlans use the command "vlan database" from exec mode
After creating all desired vlans use "exit" to apply the config

To view existing vlans use the command "show vlan-switch brief"

Warning: You are using an old IOS image for this router.
Please update the IOS to enable the "macro" command!
